# Default Agent Instructions for Cursor

## Consistency & Styling
- **Preserve Existing Styling and Design:**  
  Always maintain the current UI components, design patterns, and code formatting. Any new code must integrate seamlessly with the existing design.
- **Maintain Code Consistency:**  
  Ensure that variable naming, function definitions, and overall code structure align with the current codebase. Avoid introducing style or formatting changes unless explicitly requested.

## Code Integrity & Architecture
- **Do Not Duplicate or Reuse Code:**  
  Reuse existing components and modules wherever possible. Do not create duplicate code files; instead, integrate new functionality into the existing code.
- **Maintain Existing Directory Structure:**  
  Always integrate new code into the current directory hierarchy. Do not recreate, duplicate, or reorganize existing directories or folder structures.
- **Preserve Existing Features:**  
  Do not alter or break current features or functionalities. Validate any changes against the current behavior of the application.

## Code Quality & Documentation
- **Clean and Readable Code:**  
  Generate code that is clear, concise, and well-structured. Follow best practices for readability and maintainability.
- **Well-Commented:**  
  Include meaningful comments and docstrings that explain the purpose and logic behind code blocks. Comments should clarify why a piece of code exists and how it fits into the overall system.
- **Scalable and Secure:**  
  Write code that is scalable, robust in error handling, and adheres to security best practices (e.g., proper input validation and avoiding hardcoded sensitive data).

## Agent Behavior Guidelines
- **Non-Invasive Modifications:**  
  Limit changes to only what is necessary. Always assess the current code context before applying modifications.
- **Alignment with Architecture:**  
  Follow the project's established architectural guidelines and design patterns. When refactoring or generating new code, ensure it fits seamlessly within the existing structure.
- **Verification Before Application:**  
  Confirm that any automated changes have been thoroughly reviewed to ensure they do not disrupt existing functionalities.
